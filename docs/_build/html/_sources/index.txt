WinFault documentation
======================

This module includes the `WT_data` class, which enables you to import wind
turbine SCADA data. From there, the fault-free SCADA data can be extracted, as
well as various types of faults, according to separate status and warning data.
This is then labelled as such and split into training and testing data for fault
classification and prediction.

Usage Example
-------------
Import using ``import winfault``.

Create the class, and access correctly formatted SCADA data::

	Turbine = winfault.WT_data()
	scada_data = Turbine.scada_data
	fault_free_data = Turbine.fault_free_scada_data

Access columns by typing ``data['column name']``. The following gets the first 100 windspeeds of the fault_free_data::

	fault_free_data['WEC_ava_windspeed'][0:99]

Get all the fault data using default values (type help(Turbine.filter) or help(Turbine.get_all_fault_data) for details)::

	all_faults_scada_data, feeding_fault_scada_data, \
    mains_failure_fault_scada_data, aircooling_fault_scada_data, \
    excitation_fault_scada_data, generator_heating_fault_scada_data = \
    Turbine.get_all_fault_data()

Generate training and testing data for fault-free, feeding fault and mains failure faults, using specific features::

	features = ['Time',
            'WEC_ava_windspeed',
            'WEC_ava_Rotation',
            'WEC_ava_Power',
            'WEC_ava_reactive_Power',
            'WEC_ava_blade_angle_A',
            'Inverter_averages',
            'Inverter_std_dev']

	fault_data_sets = [feeding_fault_scada_data, mains_failure_fault_scada_data]
	X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, X_train_bal, y_train_bal = \
    Turbine.get_test_train_data(features, fault_data_sets, fault_free_data,
                                True, 0.2)

Note on the SCADA, status and warning data
------------------------------------------

SCADA Data
~~~~~~~~~~

The CSV file for this data is located at "Source Data\\SCADA_data.csv". It
contains time-stamped operational data for the turbine. The timestamps are at 10
minute intervals which represent the average of the sensor readings over that
period.

Status Data
~~~~~~~~~~~
There are a number of normal operating states for the turbine. For example, when
the turbine is producing power normally, when the wind speed is below cut-in, or when the turbine is in “storm” mode, i.e., when the wind speeds are too high for normal generation.

There are also a large number of statuses for when the turbine is in abnormal or
faulty operation. These are all tracked by status messages, contained within the “Status”
data. This is split into two different sets:

* WEC status data ("Source Data\\status_data_wec.csv")
* RTU status data ("Source Data\\status_data_rtu.csv")

The WEC (Wind Energy Converter) status data corresponds to status messages directly
related to the turbine itself, whereas RTU data corresponds to power control data
at the point of connection to the grid, i.e., active and reactive power set points.

Each time the WEC or RTU status changes, a new timestamped status message is generated.
Thus, the turbine or RTU is assumed to be operating in that state until the next status
message is generated. Each turbine/RTU status has a “main status” and “sub-status” code
associated with it. 

Any main WEC status code above zero indicates abnormal or faulty behaviour, however
many of these are not associated with a fault, e.g., status code 2 - “lack of wind”.

The RTU status data almost exclusively deals with active or reactive power set-points. For example, status 100 : 82 corresponds to limiting the active power output to 82% of
its actual current output.

Warning Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The “Warning” data on the turbine mostly corresponds to general information about
the turbine, and usually isn’t directly related to turbine operation or safety.
These “warning” messages, also called “information messages” in some of the turbine documentation, are timestamped in the same way as the status messages, and also
have a "main warning" and "sub-warning" code associated with them.

Sometimes, warning messages correspond to a potentially developing fault on the
turbine; if the warning persists for a set amount of time and is not cleared by
the turbine operator or control system, a fault is raised and a new status message
is generated.

The warning data is also split into WEC and RTU warning data:

* WEC warning data ("Source Data\\warning_data_wec.csv")
* RTU warning data ("Source Data\\warning_data_rtu.csv")
